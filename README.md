# Common Data Model Builder (cdmb)

The Common Data Model Builder (cdmb) is a Python library that facilitates building data models for projects with a defined structure. The library offers two ways to generate data models: using code or using a graphical interface. The library facilitates  completing the project's metadata, including the cohort's definition, the entities and the validation rules of the data model. The cdmb assists a user in systematically generating a reproducible folder structure of the research project as a Research Object (RO) easily implemented in as part of a deployable workflow.

# User Interface
#### Main functionalities:
One of the functionalities of Common Data Model Builder is to provide the user with a graphical interface to fill in the Common Data Model and export it in a simple way. Follow the following code snippet to access it.
#### Inputs:
- **server_address**: a string representing the server address, default value is "localhost"
- **port**: a string representing the server port, default value is "8501"

#### Example:
```python
from cdmb import launch_ui

server_address = "localhost"
port = 8000

launch_ui(server_address, port)
# Open your web browser at http://<server_address>:<port>.
# http://localhost:8000
```

# Run in Docker
Alternatively you can run the graphical interface provided by the Common Data Model Builder directly in a docker container.

Use the following code snippet to create the container.
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cienciadedatosysalud/cdmb:latest

docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8501:8501 --name cdmb_ui ghcr.io/cienciadedatosysalud/cdmb:latest

# Open your web browser at http://localhost:8501.
```


# Outputs
Outputs structure and content is described below including the files and folders that are generated when creating a research project with the `cdmb` Python library. There are four main folders corresponding to:

- __docs/CDM/__
  - **cdmb_config.json**: Configuration file.
  - **cohort_definition_inclusion.csv**: csv file that defines the criteria (i.e., codes) for inclusion in a cohort.
  - **cohort_definition_exclusion.csv**: csv file that defines the criteria (i.e., codes) for exclusion in a cohort.
  - **common_datamodel.xlsx**: The definition of the common data model in Excel format.
  - **entities/**: Folder structure where, for each defined entity, the catalogs and the established validation rules are stored.
  - **ER.gv, ER.gv.png**: an Entity-Relationship Diagram of the entities included in the CDM.
  - **synthetic-data/**: Folder structure contaning an automatically generated set of 1000 synthetic records per entity included en the CDM.
  - **hashed_files_list.json**: List of the files generated or used after generating the project with their md5 hash. This file must be kept hidden 
and should be used to cross-check with the results obtained from the analysis from the original input files.
- __inputs/__
  - **data.duckdb**: Database that temporarily contains the data entered by the user (synthetic data by default)
- __outputs/__
  - (Default directory of all the outputs produced in the project execution)

  - __check_load-scripts/__
    - **check_load.py**: Script in charge of the mapping between the files introduced by the user (./inputs) and map them to the defined entities (inputs/data.duckdb). 
    In the loading process, the following checks are performed: Name of the variables match; the format/type of the variables match those established in the configuration.
    - __inputs/__: Auxiliary folder for the script 'check_load.py'.
  - __dqa-scripts/__
    - **dqa.py**: Data Quality Assesment script by default.

## Common Data Model
#### Main functionalities:
- The CommonDataModel class represents a common data model that can be used to define metadata, cohorts, entities, and relationships in a data project.
- It provides methods to add and remove entities, set and get metadata and cohort information, and save the project to a specified directory.
- It also has a method to generate a JSON structure representing the data model and a method to load a previous configuration from a dictionary or from web files.

#### Methods:
- `__init__`: Initializes the CommonDataModel object with metadata, cohort, entities, and relationships.
- `add_entity`: Adds an entity to the list of entities.
- `pop_entity`: Removes and returns the last entity from the list of entities.
- `save_project`: Saves the project to a specified directory by calling various private methods to write metadata, cohort, entities, relationships, and other project files.
- `save_zipped_project`: Saves the project to a temporary directory, creates a zip file of the project, and returns the UUID of the zip file.
- `generate_json_structure`: Generates a JSON structure representing the data model.
- `load_previous_configuration`: Loads a previous configuration from a dictionary and returns the metadata, cohort, entities, and relationships.
- `get_er`: Generates an entity-relationship diagram (ER diagram) for the entities and relationships.


#### Example:
```python
from cdmb import Metadata
from cdmb import Author
from cdmb import Cohort
from cdmb import Entity
from cdmb import Variable
from cdmb import Relationship
import datetime

from cdmb.CommonDataModel import CommonDataModel

metadata = Metadata(project='Test Project', use_case='Use Case')

author = Author(
        name='John Doe', 
        affiliation='University of California', 
        id='0000-0000-0000-0001'
      )

metadata = Metadata(project='Test Project', use_case='Use Case')
metadata.add_author(author)

cohort = Cohort(
        name='Cohort name',
        description='Cohort description',
        inclusion_criteria='Inclusion criteria text',
        beggining_study_period=datetime.date(2021, 1, 1),
        end_study_period=datetime.date(2021, 12, 31)
    )


main_entity = Entity(
        name='Admission',
        time_varying=False,
        variables=[
            Variable('patient_id', "Patient's pseudonymized id"),
            Variable('service_cd', "Service's code")
        ])
services_entity = Entity(
        name='Service',
        time_varying=False,
        variables=[
            Variable('code', "Service's code"),
            Variable('description', "Service's description")
        ])

rel = Relationship(
    left_entity = main_entity,
    right_entity = services_entity,
    left_column =  Variable('service_cd', "Service's code"),
    right_column = Variable('code', "Service's code"),
    join_type= "LEFT JOIN" # Join Options -> ["LEFT JOIN", "INNER JOIN", "RIGHT JOIN", "FULL JOIN"]
)

cdmb_ =  CommonDataModel(
    metadata_definition=metadata,
    cohort_definition=cohort,
    entities=[main_entity,services_entity],
    relationships=[rel]
)

cdmb_.save_project(out_dir='outputs') # save folder structure
cdmb_.save_zipped_project(out_dir='outputs') # save zip
```
# Data types
Several data types are used to restrict the values that can take certain variables or parameters. 
For example:

-  **NatureOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**Condition**", "**Intervention**", "**Drugs**" or "**Any**".

-  **FormatOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**String**", "**Boolean**", "**Date**", "**Datetime**", "**Integer**" or "**Double**".

-  **TypeOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**Categorical**", "**Date**" or "**Numerical**".

-  **RequirementOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**Required**", "**Recommended**" or "**Optional**".

-  **JoinOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**LEFT JOIN**", "**INNER JOIN**", "**RIGHT JOIN**" or "**FULL JOIN**".

-  **CharacteristicOptions**: is a data type that can only take the values "**Observed**" or "**Calculated**".

-  **ComparisonOperators**: is a data type that can only take the values '**<**', '**<=**', '**>**', '**>=**', '**=**', '**<>**', '!='.

-  **BooleanOperators**: is a data type that can only take the values '**and**' or '**or**'.
