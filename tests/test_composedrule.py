Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The ComposedRule class is a subclass of the abstract class Rule and represents a complex rule that combines two other rules using a logical operator (and/or). It allows the creation of more complex rules by combining simpler rules.

Methods:
- __init__(self, left_statement: Rule, logical_operator: BooleanOperators, right_statement: Rule): Constructor that initializes the ComposedRule object with two Rule objects and a logical operator to combine them.
- expression(self): Returns the expression of the composed rule as a string.
- name(self): Returns the name of the composed rule as a string.
- description(self): Returns the description of the composed rule as a string.
- subtype_comparison(self): Returns the subtype comparison of the composed rule.
- get_structure(self): Returns a dictionary with the expression, name, and description of the composed rule.

Fields:
- _expression: A string that represents the expression of the composed rule.
- _name: A string that represents the name of the composed rule.
- _description: A string that represents the description of the composed rule.
- _subtype_comparison: The subtype comparison of the composed rule.
