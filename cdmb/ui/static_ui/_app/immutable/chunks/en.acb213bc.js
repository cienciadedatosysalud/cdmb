The labeling convention must not hinder analyses; thus AVOID using reserved characters or numbers on variable names. The variable labeling 'variable_label' SHOULD include information about the variable type to facilitate identification while exploring the data interactively, being specific about the data type. A common convention is to use "_cd" for categorical variables, "_nm" for numeric, "_bl" for boolean, and "_dt" for dates. A special case is "_id" which should be reserved for the primary (and/or secondary) key of an entity.`,conventions_3:"The encoding of variables SHOULD BE explicitly declared when a reference encoding exists (or is required) (i.e., category convention, catalogue, classification, etc.), category convention, catalogue, classification or standard.",conventions_4:"The variable format may be recorded differently depending on the data types enabled in each programming language, but will normally be defined as 'integer', 'double' or 'float' if it is a number, 'string' or 'character' if it is an alphanumeric (text), 'logical' if it is TRUE or FALSE, and 'date' or 'timestamp' if it is a date.",conventions_5:"The requirement level 'requirement_level' refers to the need for the variable to complete the study objectives. It does not mean that the referenced variables do not admit missing values rather than all their values SHOULD NOT BE MISSING.

'Recommende' variables have an impact on the achievement of one of the study objectives, and 'Optional' variables may have an impact on some additional analysis.",conventions_6:"Comments on possible data sources and observations on source transformation rules are outside the scope of the data model specification and are there to provide additional information to facilitate the data management and ETL processes at source.
